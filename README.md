### Notes
---
Considering the time limitation, some desired developments weren't implemented or weren't implemented in the best away:

- UI using some front-end frameworks such as React or Angular
- Include more tests, especially on the Services layer 
- The CSV reading process may be improved
- Filter methods could be more generic
- Restaurant and Cuisine classes relation was simplified, in a complete CRUD this would be a problem
